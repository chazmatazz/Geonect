Details
-------

Uses OpenNI to provide high-level interpretation of the Kinect data. Uses Cinder.

Installation on OS X with Xcode 4
---------------------------------

First, get libusb and the kinect patch at http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Manual_Build_under_OSX. Patch libusb.

From http://discussions.info.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2614064&amp;tstart=0, do the following:

env CFLAGS="-arch i386" ./configure; make
mv libusb/.libs/libusb-1.0.0.dylib /tmp/libusb-1.0.0.dylib.i386
make clean
nv CFLAGS="-arch x86_64" ./configure; make
mv libusb/.libs/libusb-1.0.0.dylib /tmp/libusb-1.0.0.dylib.x86_64
lipo -create /tmp/libusb-1.0.0.dylib.i386 /tmp/libusb-1.0.0.dylib.x86_64 -output libusb/.libs/libusb-1.0.0.dylib
sudo make install

Install all the stuff on the OpenNI page. Just grab binaries.

Change to your blocks directory

git clone https://github.com/pixelnerve/BlockOpenNI.git

Go to https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect. Download the binary file for OS X. Install.

Now create your new project with TinderBox. Modify the following:
  * Add "$(CINDER_PATH)/blocks/BlockOpenNI/include/OpenNI" to your Header Search Paths
  * Add "$(CINDER_PATH)/blocks/BlockOpenNI/include" to your User Header Search Paths
  * Add the files in the blocks/BlockOpenNI/src folder to your sources.
  * Add "$(CINDER_PATH)/blocks/BlockOpenNI/lib/macosx/libOpenNI.dylib" to your Other Linker Flags under Debug and Release.

You can now compile. However, you will get an xml error.

This is a hack: You need to copy BlockOpenNI/samples/BlockOpenNISample/data  to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Geonect-<some-id>/Build/Products/Debug/. This should be done with a resource.

Now you should be good to go. If you get No PS sensor is connected! error, try running another Kinect program, and then running again.

Installation on Windows
-----------------------

This should be easy, but has not been done yet.
